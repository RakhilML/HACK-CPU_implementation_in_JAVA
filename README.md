# HACK-CPU_implementation_in_JAVA
Starting from the implementation of NAND gates, calling all constituent elements as per the architecture, and finally delivering the functionality of CPU. giving an input bit sequence and showing the corresponding output.

You will need a Main method to execute all these files. For better improvisation, each gates takes a input to check whether our output matches the truth table or not.
